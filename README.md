### THOROUGH EXPLANATIONS FOR THE WHOLE COVERAGE OF THIS PROJECT

Step by step:

- created a repo for the project in GitHub.com added with README.md file.

- Start with an index.html page, create a src folder and inside it add scss(sass-for the designs and add all scss files inside it), and js folder(for all js files & functionality).

- Deploy to netlify and secure it will work well.

- Install package.json - npm init -y

- Install bootstrap, sass & live-server - npm install -D sass bootstrap live-server

- Add link imports to the sass file(@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss";)

- Add this to the json script ("build": "sass src/scss:dist/css",
  "watch": "sass --watch src/scss:dist/css",
  "start": "npm run build && live-server").

- Start the design & layout for desktop version in adobe XD. Choose font-styles, sizes and WCAG approved color for accessibility. Apply prototype for that and do the testing on browser. Then apply the design on the HTML pages.

- Start with all HTML pages required. Started with searching good bootstrap snippet that suits to my project needs.

- Applying bootstrap utilities(classes to add more betterness to the designs to save time).

- Start with the js functionality for each pages.

- Started with creating the login, logout and register page. Apply the functionality for each and test if it is working okay. Trial and errors fixing just to secure it is working according to what it should be. Asking some classmates to test it themselves and gather their feedback to fix all errors found.

- Arranging the layout of the landing page inside the html and added some features like images and buttons and checking out what is to be inside the landing page .

- Creating the following pages Profile, UserLists, Specific bid content and other pages that has connections to it.

- Asking some fellows on school to thoroughly test it and some teachers basic feedbacks if everythings works well for them via testing if register, login, logout is working great. in addition after everything is settled I ask for testing the create a list if they can create a list after they have successfully login then check their own listings.Tested also if non-users can able to search.
